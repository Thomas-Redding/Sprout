# Sprout

Unshackled Python & Web

## Motivation
Sprout is intended to provide an easy way for you to extend your macOS computer's abilities while only knowing Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By default, Sprout isn't meant for users, but for developers. It makes it relatively easy to

- Displaying widgets on your desktop.
- Create an App Launcher.
- Support window snapping.
- etc.
